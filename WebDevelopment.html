        <h2>What is Web Development ?</h2>
        <p>Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.</p>
        <img id="img" src="webdev.jpg" alt="Web Development">
        <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[2] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[3] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
        <h2>There are three types of Web Development:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li><b>Front-end Development:</b> This is the interface of a website that the users see and interact with directly via the browser. Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the outer design, and functionality that the end users can see in their web browsers</li>

            <li><b>Back-end Development:</b> This is a backend component of a website that contains the main logic running in the background and making your website work as expected. Back-end developers work on the server-side things of a website, and some of their common tasks include working on the storage part of large data, authentication authorization, and background communications using API.</li>


            <li><b>Full-stack Development:</b> Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end of a website. It is the combination of the work done in frontend and backend development.</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Road-Map To Become expert in Frontend Development </h2>
        <p>Frontend development means to design the face of a website or application. It involves working on the appearance of the website. Building interactive buttons, using images and animations, or any other aspect that involves enhancing the appearance of the webpage.

            A web developer is one of the most demanding and highest-paying jobs in India or abroad. Web developers are huge in demand and so is the profession. The average pay of a web developer is INR 7-8 LPA in India and USD 100 thousand per annum in the US. With huge pay and high demand, it is also not so difficult to become one.</p>

            <h1 style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 40px;">1.HTML</h1>
            <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
                
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page</p>

                <h1 style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 40px;">2.CSS</h1>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                    
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
