                    <p class="p2">Basic programming languages include a set of vocabularies coders use in computer and software development to create and maintain applications, queries, and scripts for different applications. Computers use various languages to communicate. Computers can only understand these languages since they're in a machine-readable format. As a software developer, you may use one language to create code to control an industrial machine, to act as a point-of-sale system for a local grocer, or create a mobile application to be used globally.
                        Just like our language, programming has its syntax, rules, and structure in its languages. The languages may work under specific conditions or be compatible with most systems. Besides research and maintenance, coding is a key element in the software development cycle. As a developer, once you understand how to use a language, you can write the source code in a text editor, execute it on an interpreter, or compile it for execution</p>

                    <p class="p2">For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever. </p>

                        Narrow, sometimes referred to as "weak," AI tends to offer efficiency-focused capabilities. Examples include digital assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
                        
                        General AI, sometimes called "strong," refers to technologies that transform computers and digital devices into machines that can think using creative and abstract processes — technology that doesn’t exist just yet .</p>

                    <p class="p2">Data analysts translate numbers and data into information that can be used to solve problems or track business. They use data analysis to produce accessible graphs, charts, tables and reports.

                        Data analysts are in high demand across all sectors, such as finance, consulting, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, government and education.
                        
                        The ability to pay attention to detail, communicate well and be highly organised are essential skills for data analysts. They not only need to understand the data but be able to provide insight and analysis through clear visual, written and verbal communication.</p>
