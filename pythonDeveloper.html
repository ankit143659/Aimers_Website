                    <h1>1. Python</h1>
                    <h2>What is Python ?</h2>
                    <p>Python is a programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented, and considered to be high-level too. What is Python? Python is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages which is widely used in the software industry. People use Python for Competitive Programming, Web Development, and creating software. Due to its easiest syntax, it is recommended for beginners who are new to the software engineering field. Its demand is growing at a very rapid pace due to its vast use cases in Modern Technological fields like Data Science, Machine learning, and Automation Tasks. For many years now, it has been ranked among the top Program</p>

                    <h1>2. Fast Api (The latest Python Framewok)</h1>
                    <h2>What is Fast Api Framework do ?</h2>
                    <p>FastAPI is a modern web framework that is relatively fast and used for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python-type hints. FastAPI also assists us in automatically producing documentation for our web service so that other developers can quickly understand how to use it. This documentation simplifies testing web service to understand what data it requires and what it offers. FastAPI has many features like it offers significant speed for development and also reduces human errors in the code. It is easy to learn and is completely production-ready. FastAPI is fully compatible with well-known standards of APIs (i.e. OpenAPI and JSON schema).</p>

                    <h2>Let us learn full course of Fast Api Framework </h2>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7t2alSnE2-I?si=DlQYPDa7XSUQ-KXl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <h2>Features of Fast Api : </h2>
                    <li><b>Automatic Documentation:</b> FastAPI generates interactive API documentation automatically using the OpenAPI standard. You can access this documentation by visiting a specific endpoint in your application, which makes it incredibly easy to understand and test your API without having to write extensive documentation manually.</li>

                    <li><b>Python Type Hints:</b> One of FastAPI’s standout features is its use of Python-type hints. By annotating function parameters and return types with type hints, you not only improve code readability but also enable FastAPI to automatically validate incoming data and generate accurate API documentation. This feature makes your code less error-prone and more self-documenting.</li>

                    <li><b>Data Validation:</b> FastAPI uses Pydantic models for data validation. You can define your data models using Pydantic’s schema and validation capabilities. This ensures incoming data is automatically validated, serialized, and deserialized, reducing the risk of handling invalid data in your application.</li>

                    <li><b>Asynchronous Support:</b> With the rise of asynchronous programming in Python, FastAPI fully embraces asynchronous operations. You can use Python’s async and await keywords to write asynchronous endpoints, making it well-suited for handling I/O-bound tasks and improving the overall responsiveness of your application.</li>

                    <li><b>Dependency Injection:</b> FastAPI supports dependency injection, allowing you to declare dependencies for your endpoints. This helps in keeping your code modular, testable, and maintainable. You can seamlessly inject dependencies like database connections, authentication, and more into your routes.</li>
