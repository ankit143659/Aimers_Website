        <h2>What is Programming Languages ?</h2>
        <p>A programming language is a set of instructions and syntax used to create software programs. Some of the key features of programming languages include:</p>
        <p>
            <li>Syntax: The specific rules and structure used to write code in a programming language.</li>
            <li>Data Types: The type of values that can be stored in a program, such as numbers, strings, and booleans.</li>
            <li>Variables: Named memory locations that can store values.</li>
            <li>Operators: Symbols used to perform operations on values, such as addition, subtraction, and comparison.</li>
            <li>Control Structures: Statements used to control the flow of a program, such as if-else statements, loops, and function calls</li>
            <li>Libraries and Frameworks: Collections of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks and speed up development</li>
            <li>Paradigms: The programming style or philosophy used in the language, such as procedural, object-oriented, or functional.</li>
        </p>

        <p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. It’s used to write software programs and applications, and to control and manipulate computer systems. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax, structure, and set of commands. Some of the most commonly used programming languages include Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, and C#. The choice of programming language depends on the specific requirements of a project, including the platform being used, the intended audience, and the desired outcome. Programming languages continue to evolve and change over time, with new languages being developed and older ones being updated to meet changing needs.</p>

            <h1 style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 40px;">1.C</h1>
            <h2>What is C language ? </h2>
            <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python</p>
            <p>It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’

                It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.</p>

            <h1 style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 40px;">2.C++</h1>
            <h2>What is C++ language ? </h2>
            <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.
                One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.</p>

                <h1 style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 40px;">3.SQL</h1>
            <h2>What is SQL ? </h2>
            <p>Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced S-Q-L; historically "sequel")[4][5] is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

                Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.
                
                Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[6] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).[7]</p>

                    <h2>What is JAVA ? </h2>
                    <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.

                        JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
